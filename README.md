# F2_genotype_processing
scripts for filtering and binning ddRAD data from an F2 mapping population, creating a linkage map using lepMap3, and processing lepMap files into a format that can be used by rQTL / QTL Cartographer

this is the process that I use to filter ddRAD genotypes from F2 mapping populations, after I've created 012 files in vcftools (my pipeline for going from fastqs to vcf is here: (https://www.protocols.io/view/processing-ddrad-data-from-raw-fastqs-to-vcf-bjnbkman)).
